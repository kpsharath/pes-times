# PES Times

PES Times. A unified PES University web portal for the students and by the students. From an information center for upcoming events 
to a social platform for the students to discuss and socialize, PES Times is an attempt at making all the scattered Facebook pages and 
groups for different clubs and events obsolete. This portal tries to solve the problem of students missing out on events and meetings 
just because they weren’t properly notified or forgot to check the respective pages on Facebook. Additionally, it provides a means for 
student discussions, interactions and suggestions, regardless of the year or department the student belongs to. It takes a crack at 
making the signup process for different occasions easier and user-friendly. PES Times also makes an effort to organize the numerous clubs 
in PES University. Different clubs have different pages where they can upload photos, create events and keep a calendar of upcoming events, 
and a lot more. Finally, buying the books second hand from Campus Mart or asking around the seniors is always a real pain. This PES 
portal aims to ease this process with the “Book Exchange” feature, which is like a forum where users can put up books they are trying 
to sell and interested students can contact them. The object of PES Times is to create a globalized and unified portal so that the students 
do not need to look for anything more, anywhere else.
